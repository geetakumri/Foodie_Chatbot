# Foodie_Chatbot

Problem Statement :-
With advancements in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP), traditional conversational chatbots have now become advanced and are called contextual chatbots. 

We will build a domain-specific chatbot, specifically, a restaurant search chatbot. The bot will be able to 'talk' to users in English, and will help them search for restaurants offering multiple cuisines, suiting different budgets, etc., in several cities. You will be using an open-source machine learning (ML) framework called Rasa for building these conversational bots.
